# Halcyon: Android-based game project
## A therapy-based mobile game implementing a Depth-first search algorithm for procedural maze generation. Written in C# using the Unity Engine. 

This is a final year project created as a Therapy-based game designed to help alleviate symptoms of stress and anxiety.
The finished project includes the following:
* Scripts implementing desired behaviours attached to objects.
* A script to create an X-by-X grid of node objects with node walls removed based on a Depth-first search algorithm. This creates a procedurally generated maze.
* Random placement of Destination object which collides with player object to trigger next scene.
* Progressive level difficuly, using Scene Manager.
* Implementation of nature-based sound to elicit a calming effect on the player.
* A simple UI.
* Tilt mechanics.
